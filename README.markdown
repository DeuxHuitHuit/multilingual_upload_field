# 1 About #

This is a multilingual version of the classic upload field. It works the same way as a single upload field, but supports multiple languages, the same way as [Multilingual text](https://github.com/6ui11em/multilingual_field). It offers on demand unique file names and outputs to Frontend the filename for current Frontend language code.

**VERY IMPORTANT**<br />
This extension depends on [Frontend Localisation](https://github.com/vlad-ghita/frontend_localisation). From there it draws it's Frontend language information. This way I'm trying to decouple my multilingual stuff from various Language drivers out there.<br />
Get Frontend Localisation, a language driver (Language Redirect for example) and you're good to go.

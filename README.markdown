## 1 About ##

This is a multilingual version of the classic upload field. It works the same way as a single upload field, but supports multiple languages, the same way as [Multilingual text](https://github.com/6ui11em/multilingual_field). It offers on demand unique file names and outputs to Frontend the filename for current Frontend language code.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Multilingual File Upload", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
